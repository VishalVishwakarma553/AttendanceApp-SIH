# Automated Student Attendance Monitoring and Analytics System

## Project Overview
A comprehensive React + Vite application with Framer Motion for smooth animations, designed to automate attendance tracking and provide analytics for colleges. The system will use simulated backend with promises for development.


## User Roles & Access Levels

### 1. Student Role
- **Dashboard**: Personal attendance overview
- **QR Scanner**: Scan attendance QR codes
- **Face Recognition**: Register face and mark attendance via facial recognition
- **Attendance History**: View personal attendance records
- **Analytics**: Personal engagement metrics
- **Profile Management**: Update personal information and facial data

### 2. Faculty Role
- **Dashboard**: Class-wise attendance overview
- **QR Generation**: Generate QR codes for attendance
- **Face Recognition Setup**: Configure facial recognition sessions
- **Student Management**: View and manage student lists with facial data
- **Attendance Records**: Mark/edit attendance manually or via multiple methods
- **Analytics**: Class engagement and attendance trends by method
- **Reports**: Generate attendance reports with method breakdown

### 3. Admin Role
- **Master Dashboard**: Institution-wide analytics
- **User Management**: Manage students, faculty accounts with biometric data
- **Course Management**: Create/manage courses and subjects
- **Department Analytics**: Department-wise insights with method preferences
- **System Settings**: Configure attendance rules and facial recognition settings
- **Biometric Management**: Manage facial data, privacy settings, and recognition accuracy
- **Advanced Reports**: Comprehensive reporting system with multi-method analysis
